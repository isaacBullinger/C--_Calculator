# Overview

I wrote a calculator in C++. The calculator can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and does exponents and square roots. The output history is stored in a text file and can be loaded by pressing l.

My purpose for writing this software was to learn the C++ language.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with the NeoVim extension. I also wrote a bash script to compile and run my C++ code, which I included.

I used C++ with iostream, string, fstream, sstream, and cmath libraries.
